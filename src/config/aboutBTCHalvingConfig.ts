      question: "What is a Bitcoin block halving event?    ",
      answer:
        "Block halving events happen every 4 years or 210,000 blocks on Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin's initial block reward was 50 BTC. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, the next block reward will be 3.125 BTC. This lowers the rate at which Bitcoins are generated. The halving is periodical and is programmed into Bitcoin's code.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why was this done?    ",
      answer:
        "Conventional FIAT currencies are subject to inflation due to the ability of governments or banks to increase the money supply. Unlike these currencies, Bitcoin has a capped total supply of 21,000,000 BTC, meaning no additional coins can be created beyond this limit. This finite supply, alongside potential changes in demand as more people adopt Bitcoin, positions it similarly to gold - a resource with a limited supply that cannot be artificially increased.",
